USA Visa Appointment Time Checker

- Node.js programming skills required, read code
- MacOS-specific notifications calls

You'll need to:
- change appointment urls in index.js (see comments)
- Set username(email) and password:
  - USA_USER
  - USA_PASSWD
- change the cut-off date to something instead of '2024-04-04', if you want an appointment before this date.

Sorry it's just a small thingy for myself, if you can make it more generic, please PR ;)

P.S. Getting the appointment is the toughest part, inside they are fine, but ensure all requested documents are with you. I was asked for my CV (!) Luckily I prepared it in advance (it was noted somewhere as a required document, but I didn't really expect them to want it).
